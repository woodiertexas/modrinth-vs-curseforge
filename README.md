# Problems with Curseforge
If you ever used Curseforge in any capacity in the past year or so. You probably have noticed the horrendous use of advertisements, the UI bugs and many other nonsensical things Curseforge has done. 

### Advertisments
Screenshot of the advertisements seen on CF as a normal user.

### UI Bugs
These UI problems have not been fixed for 4-ish years since Curseforge's "redesign".

Screenshot of a common UI bug. Note that the mouse cursor is not on any of the category links.

Sometimes the UI bug (pictured above) happens when you switch tabs on CF's Minecraft page.

### General Inconsistency
Not only is there terrible usage of advertisements and UI bugs, there is general inconsistency on CF as shown below

### Clunky Search
Curseforge's search is very clunky at best and outright broken at worst. If you wanted to search for a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.18.2, it is impossible to specify "Fabric", "1.18.2", and a category the mod you want might be in. You are stuck having to specify "Fabric" and a category and then scrolling until you find the mod you want. While searching via the search bar works, it takes you to a different page where all you have is a search bar to input what you want in. No categories, no Minecraft versions, no modloader filters, etc.

### New API
The new CurseForge API has only made pain since the very beginning, making life harder for launchers/mod managers/modpack builders with a restrictive ToS, locking API access behind a non-transferable key which can't be behind a proxy and introducing an opt-in system for mod distribution for third party apps.

### API Problems
The Curseforge API is plagued with issues such as "concurrent outages", starts acting up when too many requests are sent and removes mods from the the API.

### 3rd Party Platforms
CurseForge has been known to not allow mods it hosts to be used in modpacks hosted on other 3rd party platforms such as Modrinth.

![Outage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17211100/163896672-36d28e3d-e01d-4c7d-ae04-58907bb24a35.jpg)

### Favoritism
Curseforge has a habit of giving preferential treatment to popular modpacks/mods and/or groups who make popular modpacks/mods.

## Advantages of Curseforge
While CF does have clunky search, bad UI/UX, horrendous use of advertisements and so on. It has some advantages over modrinth as well such as...
 - Has the most mods of any modding platform
 - Pays out to authors
 - Very well known to practically most MC players
 - Has MC world support
 - Has an area with a randomized selection of Curseforge projects
 - If you are an author on Curseforge, you do not see any advertisements

![Authors do not see advertisements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17211100/163896862-799fcc50-08b2-488c-9e10-9491a933a947.png)

# Advantages of Modrinth
In short; search that actually works, very good UI/UX, great use of an advertisement, has very minimal UI bugs.

### Advertisements
Modrinth's ads comply with the acceptable ads standard. That means...
 - Only one ad per page
 - Ads are less than 130 pixels tall
 - Ads are distinguished from site content

### Consistency
The Modrinth UI on the mods page is very consistent compared to Curseforge's mod page UI.

### Better Search
Modrinth's search is far better than the clunky search CF has. You can specify what categories to search in, what Minecraft versions to filter, what modloaders to filter, and use your searchbar input all without leaving the mods page.

### Payouts
Modrinth now has payouts and they are based on pageviews on your mod pages. Modrinth payouts are known to be more then Curseforge, only taking 10% in favor of the authors which take 90% of earnings.

### Other Advantages
Modrinth supports old modloaders such as Rift, Risugami's modloader, and Liteloader.
Modrinth is willing to and does fix issues on their platform. (Thanks MrMelon54 for bringing this up in https://github.com/woodiertexas/modrinth-vs-curseforge/issues/4)

## Disadvantages of Modrinth
While Modrinth does excel in search, UI/UX, usage of advertisements and so on. There are some disadvantages to using Modrinth such as...
 - Does not have an area with a randomized selection of mods
