An explanation as to why Modrinth is a better modding platform than Curseforge is.

# Problems with Curseforge
If you ever used Curseforge in any capacity in the past year or so. You probably have noticed the horrendous use of advertisements, the UI bugs and many other nonsensical things Curseforge has done. 

### Advertisments
Screenshot of the advertisements seen on CF as a normal user.

Also if you are an author on Curseforge, you do not see any advertisements.

### UI Bugs
These UI problems have not been fixed for 4-ish years since Curseforge's "redesign".

Screenshot of a common UI bug. Note that the mouse cursor is not on any of the category links.

Sometimes the UI bug (pictured above) happens when you switch tabs on CF's Minecraft page.

### General Inconsistency
Not only is there terrible usage of advertisements and UI bugs, there is general inconsistency on CF as shown below

### Clunky Search
Curseforge's search is very clunky at best and outright broken at worst. If you wanted to search for a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.18.2, it is impossible to specify "Fabric", "1.18.2", and a category the mod you want might be in. You are stuck having to specify "Fabric" and a category and then scrolling until you find the mod you want. While searching via the search bar works, it takes you to a different page where all you have is a search bar to input what you want in. No categories, no Minecraft versions, no modloader filters, etc.

### API Problems
The Curseforge API is plagued with issues such as "concurrent outages", starts acting up when too many requests are sent and removes mods from the the API.

### Favoritism
Curseforge has a habit of giving preferential treatment to popular modpacks/mods and/or groups who make popular modpacks/mods.

## Advantages of Curseforge
While CF does have clunky search, bad UI/UX, horrendous use of advertisements and so on. It has some good qualities as well such as...
 - Has the most mods of any modding platform
 - Pays out to modders
 - Very well known to practically most MC players
 - Has modpack support along with "Addons", resource packs, MC worlds, and Bukkit plugins
 - Has an area with a randomized selection of Curseforge projects


# Advantages of Modrinth
In short; search that actually works, very good UI/UX, great use of an advertisement, has very minimal UI bugs.

### Advertisement

### Consistency
The Modrinth UI on the mods page is very consistent compared to Curseforge's mod page UI.

### Better Search
Modrinth's search is far better than the clunky search CF has. You can specify what categories to search in, what Minecraft versions to filter, what modloaders to filter, and use your searchbar input all without leaving the mods page.

## Disadvantages of Modrinth
While Modrinth does excel in search, UI/UX, usage of advertisements and so on. There are some disadvantages to using Modrinth such as...
 - No modder payouts yet
 - Modpack support is not released yet
 - There is no support for resource packs, MC worlds, and datapacks yet
 - There is also no support for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins
 - While a good selection of mods, it has a small amount of mods (Roughly 2k-ish)
 - Not very well known among users
 - Does not have an area with a randomized selection of mods
